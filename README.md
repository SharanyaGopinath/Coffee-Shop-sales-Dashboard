Coffee Shop sales Dashboard using Excel

## Objective
The primary goal of the coffee shop sales dashboard is to provide a clear, real-time view of critical sales metrics and performance indicators. This tool helps the café management make informed decisions to optimize operations, enhance customer experience, and drive revenue growth. The dashboard consolidates data from January 2023 to June 2023, offering insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    Total Sales: The overall revenue generated by the coffee shop.
    Total Footfall: The total number of customers visiting the café.
    Average Bill per Person: The average amount spent by each customer.
    Average Order per Person: The average number of items ordered by each customer.

### Analysis

    Peak Hours: The busiest times for coffee sales are at 10 a.m., followed by 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.
    Product Breakdown:
        Coffee accounts for 39% of total sales.
        Tea accounts for 28% of total sales.
    Order Sizes:
        31% of customers order Regular size.
        30% of customers order Large size.
    Store Performance:
        "Hell's Kitchen" has higher sales than "Astoria", indicating higher spending per customer rather than higher footfall.
        "Barista Espresso" is the top-selling café item, followed by "Brewed Chai Tea".
    Sales by Day:
        Higher sales on Mondays and Fridays.

### Recommendations

    Optimize Staffing:
        Increase staff during peak hours (8 a.m., 9 a.m., and 10 a.m.) to efficiently manage the surge in customer demand.

    Product Focus:
        Emphasize coffee offerings since they constitute the largest portion of sales. Implement targeted promotions and specials to further increase coffee sales.

    Menu Optimization:
        Given the high percentage of Regular and Large orders, tailor the menu to highlight these sizes. Use upselling strategies to encourage larger orders and add-ons.

    Marketing Strategy:
        Promote "Hell's Kitchen" offerings due to its high sales despite similar footfall to "Astoria". Consider introducing similar high-margin products at other locations.

    Capitalize on Top Sellers:
        Highlight "Barista Espresso" in marketing campaigns, promotions, and loyalty programs to leverage its popularity and drive more sales.

    Day-Based Strategies:
        Develop targeted promotions and events for Mondays and Fridays to maximize sales on these high-traffic days.

By implementing these recommendations based on dashboard insights, the coffee shop can enhance its operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and boost overall sales.
